I have built a web scraper with Beautiful Soup and Requests that will track the price of airpods (although you can use any item). It will tell you the former price and discount. Furthermore, it will send a text to your phone number alerting you of that discount.

**Steps**:
(Assuming you have python installed and a proper text editor or IDE)

1. Make sure you have the dependencies
pip install bs4 (Requests is built in)
pip install smtplib


2. Grab the URL of the web page

3. Set HEADERS = User Agent dictionary
This is used to disguise youself as a human, not as a python script

4.
