I have built a web scraper with Selenium that will track the price of airpods (although you can use any item). It will tell you the former price and discount. Furthermore, it will send a text to your phone number alerting you of that discount.

To download the Chrome Selenium webdriver, click this link [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/). 

To learn more about Selenium, see the documentation in Python [here](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/).
